Problem: CART-RF-ANN

An Insurance firm providing tour insurance is facing higher claim frequency. 
The management decides to collect data from the past few years. 
You are assigned the task to make a model which predicts the claim status and provide recommendations to management. 
Use CART, RF & ANN and compare the models' performances in train and test sets.

2.1 Read the data, do the necessary initial steps, and exploratory data analysis (Univariate, Bi-variate, and multivariate analysis).
2.2 Data Split: Split the data into test and train, build classification model CART, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network
2.3 Performance Metrics: Comment and Check the performance of Predictions on Train and Test sets using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Plot ROC curve and get ROC_AUC score, classification reports for each model.
2.4 Final Model: Compare all the models and write an inference which model is best/optimized.
2.5 Inference: Based on the whole Analysis, what are the business insights and recommendations
